        <h2 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile is-spaced">Rating lifts using the calculator</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">How do I ask for more exercises?</h3>
        <p>
            Send us a message via our
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/strengthlevel">Facebook page</a>
            and we will add your exercise to our list of exercises to consider adding.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Should I include the weight of the bar?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, include the weight of the bar. Report the total amount you lift.
            If you lift 30 kg and the bar weights 20 kg, then you should report the total amount 30 kg not 10 kg.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Should I enter all repetitions done in a workout?</h3>
        <p>
            No, just enter the number of repetitions done in a single set into the calculator. If you do 5 sets of 5
            repetitions,
            put in 5 repetitions not 25.
        </p>
        <p>
            When logged in, we recommend putting in both the sets and repetitions so that you can track your progress.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Do the number of sets impact the number of repetitions in a given
            set?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, to a small degree. With experienced lifters, muscles recover fast during strength training so if you can do
            5 reps at maximum effort at a certain weight, you can normally do another set of 4-5 reps after 2 minutes rest.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Should I stand or sit when performing exercises?</h3>
        <p>
            Our exercises standards cover both standing and sitting. Sitting is often stricter so some lifters find that
            they can lift more standing. If you are performing a upwards pressing motion, like barbell dumbbell press, you
            should have a vertical or near vertical back rest otherwise it is more like incline dumbbell press.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile is-spaced">Barbell exercises</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Should lifts be paused or touch-and-go?</h3>
        <p>
            At the moment we don't take into account how you complete the movement. Feel free to rate both paused and
            touch-and-go lifts.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile is-spaced">Dumbbell exercises</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Should I double the weight for dumbbell exercises?</h3>
        <p>
            Put in the weight of what you have in one hand not both hands. For example if you can
            dumbbell press 90 lb in each arm, put in 90 lb not 180 lb.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Should I double the reps for dumbbell exercises?</h3>
        <p>
            No, log the amount of reps done for each arm and do not add them up.
            If you are logging dumbbell front raises and do 10 reps with each arm, then you would log 10 reps total not 20
            reps.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Should I use both arms on one dumbbell?</h3>
        <p>
            No, the dumbbell standards are set for one dumbbell per arm. If you want to log lifts where you use both
            arms on a single dumbbell then treat them as barbell lifts, or ask us to add additional exercises on
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/strengthlevel">Facebook</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile is-spaced">Bodyweight exercises</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Why is additional weight rated better than higher bodyweight when the
            total weight is the
            same?</h3>
        <p>
            A lifter is better if they can lift the same weight at less bodyweight. Like at the Olympics where you have
            weight categories â€” heavier lifters have to lift more. That is why if you record bodyweight plus extra weight
            your performance is intermediate, whereas if you put all the weight into the bodyweight box your performance is
            classed as novice even though the total weight lifted is the same.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile is-spaced">Cable exercises</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Do some cable machines have an advantage over others?</h3>
        <p>
            Some machines have a 2:1 mechanical advantage on the pulley so you can lift double what you could with a
            dumbbell/barbell. Use machines with 1:1 pulleys or divide the weight lifted by 2 so that you do not look
            stronger than you are.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile is-spaced">One-rep-max calculator</h2>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">What formula do you use on the 1RM calculator?</h3>
        <p>
            Under 8 reps we use the Brzycki formula and over 10 reps we use the Epley formula.
            We found Brzycki is more accurate at lower rep ranges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between 8 and 10 repetitions we use a linear interpolation of Brzycki and Epley so 9 repetitions is 50-50.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile is-spaced">Strength Level standards</h2>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">Are the strength standards based on lifts entered?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we take all the lifts entered into Strength Level and calculate standards for each exercise.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4 is-size-5-mobile">How do you stop strength standards being affected by false lifts?</h3>
        <p>We perform analysis on the lifts entered and filter out robots and lifters who enter too many lifts.</p>
